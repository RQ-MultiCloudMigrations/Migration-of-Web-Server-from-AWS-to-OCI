# Migration-of-Web-Server-from-AWS-to-OCI
This project involved migrating a web server and domain from AWS to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Using a site-to-site VPN Tunnel, the server was moved from AWS EC2 with Nginx to OCI compute instances. Image transfer between Amazon S3 and OCI Object Storage was done using rclone, followed by testing to ensure proper functionality.
